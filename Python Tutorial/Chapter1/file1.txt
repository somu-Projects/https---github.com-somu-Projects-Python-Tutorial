A function is a collection of related assertions that performs a mathematical, analytical, or evaluative operation. Python functions are simple to define and essential to intermediate-level programming. The exact criteria hold to function names as they do to variable names. The goal is to group up certain often performed actions and define a function. Rather than rewriting the same code block over and over for varied input variables, we may call the function and repurpose the code included within it with different variables.

The functions are broad of two types, user-defined and built-in functions. It aids in keeping the software succinct, non-repetitive, and well-organized.
