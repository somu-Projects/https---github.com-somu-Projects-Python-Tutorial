    "# Python Regex\n",
    "# ==============\n",
    "# A regular expression is a set of characters with highly specialized syntax that we can use to find or \n",
    "# match other characters or groups of characters. In short, regular expressions, or Regex, are widely used in the UNIX world.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The re-module in Python gives full support for regular expressions of Pearl style. The re module raises the re.error \n",
    "# exception whenever an error occurs while implementing or using a regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "# We'll go over two crucial functions utilized to deal with regular expressions. But first, \n",
    "# a minor point: many letters have a particular meaning when utilized in a regular expression re.match()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python's re.match() function finds and delivers the very first appearance of a regular expression pattern. \n",
    "# In Python, the RegEx Match function solely searches for a matching string at the beginning of the provided \n",
    "# text to be searched. The matching object is produced if one match is found in the first line. \n",
    "# If a match is found in a subsequent line, the Python RegEx Match function gives output as null.\n",
    "\n",
    "# x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examine the implementation for the re.match() method in Python. The expressions \".w*\" and \".w*?\" \n",
    "# will match words that have the letter \"w,\" and anything that does not has the letter \"w\" will be ignored. \n",
    "# The for loop is used in this Python re.match() illustration to inspect for matches for every element in the list of words.\n",
    "# Matching Characters.The majority of symbols and characters will easily match. \n",
    "# (A case-insensitive feature can be enabled, allowing this RE to match Python or PYTHON.) \n",
    "# The regular expression check, for instance, will match exactly the string check.There are some exceptions to this \n",
    "# general rule; certain symbols are special metacharacters that don't match. Rather,\n",
    "# they indicate that they must compare something unusual, or they have an effect on other parts of the \n",
    "# RE by recurring or modifying their meaning. Here's the list of the metacharacters;\n",
    "#     . ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \\ | ( )  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Repeating Things\n",
    "# The ability to match different sets of symbols will be the first feature regular expressions \n",
    "# can achieve that's not previously achievable with string techniques. On the other hand, Regexes isn't much o\n",
    "# f an improvement if that had been their only extra capacity. We can also define that some sections of the RE must \n",
    "# be reiterated a specified number of times.The first metacharacter we'll examine for recurring occurrences is *.\n",
    "#  Instead of matching the actual character '*,' * signals that the preceding letter can be matched 0 or even more times,\n",
    "#  rather than exactly one.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ba*t, for example, matches 'bt' (zero 'a' characters), 'bat' (one 'a' character), 'baaat' (three 'a' characters), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Greedy repetitions, such as *, cause the matching algorithm to attempt to replicate the RE as many times as feasible. If later elements of the sequence fail to match, the matching algorithm will retry with lesser repetitions.\n",
